### What is a protocol?

- A protocol is a **set of rules** that determine how computers communicate with each other.
- Protocols also govern how an internet document gets transmitted to a computer screen.
- The protocol will determine what part of the conversation comes at which time an also how the conversation ends.

### HTTP & HTTPS

- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- Determines how browsers and web servers communicate.
- **The connection is dropped once the request has been made** - "stateless system"
- HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.

### SSL & SSH

- SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
  - Used by HTTPS to provide encryption.
- SSH: Secure Shell
  - Used specifically by programmers and network administrators.
- Both of them are technically not protocols.
