- **Contact Force**

  >  A contact force is a force that requires physical contact between objects in order to exist.

- **Field Force**

  >  A field or long-range force is a force that exerts itself on an object from some distance away. 
  > *ex) Magnetic forces, Gravity* 

- **Reaction Force**

  > A force that only exists as a reaction to a different force or forces. It tends to vary in size depending upon the size of other forces. **Friction, tension and normal forces are examples** of reaction forces

- **Restoring Force**

  > A force that acts to move an object **back to an equilibrium position**.

- **Centrifugal Force**: 원심력

- **Centripetal Force**: 구심력

- **Applied Force**:  

  > A general, external force applied to an object

- **Normal Force**

  > Describes the contact force between two surfaces that points perpendicular to that surface

- **Force of Tension**: 장력

- **Spring / Elastic Force**: 탄성력

- **Frictional Forces**: 마찰력

  - Static Friction: 정지 마찰력
  - Rolling Friction: 굴림 마찰력
  - Kinetic Friction: 운동 마찰력

- **Force of Gravity**: 중력

  - Inertia: 관성

  - Mass: 질량

    - Less mass
    - More mass

  - Apparent Weight: 겉보기 무게(?)

    > * The perceived weight of an object that is being accelerated.
    > * The property of objects that corresponds to how heavy an object is.
